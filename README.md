# Diabetes Patient Identification
About one in seven U.S. adults has diabetes now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But by 2050, that rate could skyrocket to as many as one in three. With this in mind, learning how to use Machine Learning to help Pharma companies identify Diabetic patients that show characteristics that are similar to other patients with the same diagnosis for business strategy purposes.

### Question/Need:

What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

I am planning to build a model that can identify a potential diabetic patient based on the similar characteristics to other patients with this diagnostic.

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

It's economically lucrative for pharma companies as diabetes treatment drugs are often extremely expensive in the US and the per patient revenues could be very significant. That said, pharma companies can make business plans for grow based on a future demand.

### Data Description:

My initial dataset from Kaggle includes 2000 observations and 9 features that will allow me to begin my exploratory data analysis. I'm expecting to include additional features from additional datasets for a minimun of 10.

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

Centers of Disease Control and Prevention CDC has public data on this matter. Kaggle also has several datasets related to this topic.

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

Using a cohort of patients who have been confirmed to have diabetes, we can create ML models that can then be applied to other patients to identify potential undiagnosed cases / patients by including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, age, among others.

If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

Potential diabetic patients.

### Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

I'm considering to use Google Sheets for the exploratory phase. Visualization with Tableu and Pandas will be applied as well as Python for the modeling work.

Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

No so far.

### MVP Goal:

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

Some plots that can initially show diabetes diagnosis by age group as well as the correlation heatmap among the features will be part of the MVP request.
